Programming language divide into two categories :

- `Statically typed`
- `Dynamically typed`

in `Statically-typed` languages (C, Java, C#, ... ), the type of variable is set at the compile-time and cannot change later.

in `Dynamically-typed` languages (PHP, JavaScript, Python, ... ), the type of variable is determined at the run-time and can change later.

`TypeScript` is a programming language build on top of `JavaScript` ( essentially JavaScript with static typing and some additional features )  , so basically you need to know about some JavaScript concepts such as :

- Variables
- Arrays
- Objects
- Functions
- Arrow Functions
- Destructuring
- ...
